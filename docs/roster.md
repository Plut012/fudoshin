# Fudoshin Roster

*10 fighters for the initial release*

---

## Setting Context

The world exists in a state of uneasy peace after a century of fragmented wars. The old empires have collapsed into city-states, trade guilds, and wandering factions. Violence is common but small-scale — duels, mercenary work, border skirmishes.

**The Tournament of Still Water** is held every seven years at a neutral monastery. Fighters come for glory, coin, revenge, or reasons they don't share. The monks don't care why. They only care that the forms are observed.

The roster draws from this world: soldiers and nobles, monsters and outcasts, the faithful and the damned.

## Character Details

---

### 1. The Conscript

*"I didn't ask for this. But I'm still here."*

**Visual:** Young man in battered infantry armor. Sword and small shield. Tired eyes, practical stance. Nothing fancy — a working soldier's gear with dents and repairs.

**Background:** Drafted into a war that ended before he saw real combat. Now he fights in tournaments because it's the only trade he knows. Not talented, not special — just stubborn and well-drilled.

**Playstyle:** The fundamental character. Good at everything, great at nothing. Learns the game's systems through him.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Pressure** | Reliable strike/throw mix, plus frames, simple loops |
| Stagger | **Guard Break** | Standard path — volume of blocked attacks |
| Finish | **Standard** | Clean overhead strike. Nothing fancy. |

**Stance — Drill Form:** A defensive ready stance. Reduces Guard damage taken while held. No special options — just survival.

**Design Notes:**
- The "Ryu" of the roster
- First character new players should try
- No gimmicks, no tricks — just fundamentals
- His strength is having no weaknesses

---

### 2. The Duchess

*"You mistake patience for mercy."*

**Visual:** Tall woman in dueling attire — fitted jacket, high collar, riding boots. Rapier held in precise form. Silver-streaked dark hair pulled back. She looks like she's deciding whether you're worth her time.

**Background:** A countess from a fallen house, stripped of lands but not pride. She fights to rebuild her fortune and remind the world that breeding shows. Every duel is a statement.

**Playstyle:** Mid-range spacing. She controls distance, baits reactions, and punishes mistakes. Rarely commits, always threatens.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Conditioning** | Feints, delays, variable timing on thrusts |
| Stagger | **Counter Hit** | Key moves Stagger on counter — rewards baiting |
| Finish | **Standard** | A single perfect thrust through the heart |

**Stance — Invitation:** Rapier lowered, weight back. An obvious opening. If opponent attacks, she has a fast counter-thrust that Staggers on hit. If they don't, she can cancel or advance.

**Design Notes:**
- Whiff punisher, footsies specialist
- High execution ceiling — rewards precise spacing
- Looks effortless when played well
- Struggles when cornered or rushed

---

### 3. The Butcher

*"Meat is meat."*

**Visual:** Massive bald man in a stained leather apron. Carries a cleaver the size of a door. Arms like tree trunks. Looks at opponents the way he looks at livestock.

**Background:** A slaughterhouse foreman who discovered he enjoyed his work too much. Banned from three cities for "professional misconduct." The tournament is legal violence, which suits him fine.

**Playstyle:** Slow, terrifying grappler. Every read he makes hurts. He wants to get close and doesn't mind taking damage to do it.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Burst** | High-commitment moves, massive damage on hit |
| Stagger | **Command Grab** | Unblockable grab with Stagger property |
| Finish | **Grapple** | Grabs Staggered opponent — no Final Parry possible |

**Stance — Tenderizing:** Cleaver raised overhead. Armored against one hit. If he absorbs an attack and lands his follow-up, huge Guard damage. Walking forward in this stance is deeply scary.

**Design Notes:**
- Classic grappler archetype
- His finish bypasses Final Parry — terrifying
- Very slow, very readable, very punishing
- Games against him are tense every second

---

### 4. Mycella

*"The forest remembers what you've forgotten."*

**Visual:** Small humanoid figure, vaguely feminine, made of moss and mushroom. Carries a massive puffball mushroom under one arm like a mortar. Cap-like head, bioluminescent spots, black eyes that don't blink.

**Background:** A fae creature from the deep woods where the old wars poisoned the land. She's not here for glory or gold. She's here because humans are *interesting* when they're scared.

**Playstyle:** Setplay/trap character. Plants mushrooms that control space. Herds opponents into bad positions. Patient, creepy, inevitable.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Setplay** | Plants mushroom traps that explode when touched |
| Stagger | **Trap Trigger** | Touching mushroom above 50% Guard = Stagger |
| Finish | **Trap Trigger** | Staggered opponent touching mushroom = death |

**Stance — Germination:** Crouches and plants a mushroom. Can place up to 3. Mushrooms persist until triggered or destroyed (one hit kills them).

**Mushroom Properties:**
- Proximity trigger — explode when opponent walks near
- Explosion deals Guard damage and small knockback
- If Guard is above 50% when triggered, causes Stagger instead
- Staggered opponent touching mushroom = instant kill

**Design Notes:**
- Unique win condition — doesn't need to land Decisive Blow herself
- Weak in direct combat, strong in prepared situations
- "Cute" in a deeply unsettling way
- Rewards planning and spatial awareness

---

### 5. The Flagellant

*"Suffering is the only honest prayer."*

**Visual:** Gaunt man in torn robes, bare chest covered in ritual scars. Chain wrapped around one arm, weighted end dragging. Hood shadows his face but not his smile.

**Background:** A former priest who found his faith in pain rather than scripture. The church cast him out; he considers this a blessing. Every wound is a lesson, every scar a verse.

**Playstyle:** Counter-specialist who gets stronger when hit. Wants to take damage, then make you regret giving it.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Punish** | Waits for mistakes, devastating counter damage |
| Stagger | **Armor Trade** | Key moves have armor; absorb + connect = Stagger |
| Finish | **Counter** | Enters counter stance; if attacked, instant kill |

**Stance — Mortification:** Spreads arms wide, completely open. Taking damage in this stance fills a "Penance" meter. At full Penance, his next attack has massive damage and Guard break.

**Unique Mechanic — Penance:**
- Builds when taking damage (not when blocking)
- Decays slowly over time
- At full Penance: next attack Staggers on hit regardless of method

**Design Notes:**
- Risk/reward character — intentionally takes damage
- His Counter finish is the ultimate read
- Terrifying when he has Penance stocked
- Struggles if opponent refuses to engage

---

### 6. The Courier

*"Package for you. It's violence."*

**Visual:** Wiry young woman in leather travel gear, goggles pushed up on forehead. Fighting style uses a weighted satchel bag as a flail and her own momentum. Always moving, always grinning.

**Background:** Guild messenger who got bored of just delivering letters. Started delivering beatings on the side. The tournament is a paid vacation where she gets to hit people professionally.

**Playstyle:** Pure rushdown. In your face immediately and doesn't leave. Overwhelms with speed and constant pressure.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Pressure** | Fast normals, run-up options, relentless |
| Stagger | **Guard Break** | Sheer volume of blocked attacks |
| Finish | **Execution Combo** | 4-hit flurry ending in satchel slam |

**Stance — Sprinter's Start:** A runner's crouch. Launches into a fast dash that can go into attack, grab, or cross-up. Very fast, very committal.

**Unique Mechanic — Momentum:**
- Builds while moving forward, attacking, or pressuring
- Decays while stationary, blocking, or retreating
- At high Momentum: increased frame advantage on attacks

**Design Notes:**
- Aggressive, energetic, slightly unhinged
- Simple gameplan: get in, stay in, never stop
- Weak defense, weak neutral — but rarely plays neutral
- Her Execution Combo finish is the most stylish in the game

---

### 7. The Effigy

*"..."*

**Visual:** A scarecrow given terrible life. Burlap body, button eyes, straw leaking from joints. Moves in jerky stop-motion. Wields farm tools — a rusty scythe, a pitchfork. Sometimes its head rotates 180 degrees.

**Background:** No one knows what animates it. Found standing in a burned field after a border war. It walked to the tournament on its own. The monks debated refusing it entry. They decided something that determined deserves a chance.

**Playstyle:** Creepy stance-switcher with disjointed animations and hitboxes. Hard to read, hard to predict. Wins by being *wrong* in ways opponents can't process.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Conditioning** | Delayed/disjointed attacks, unnatural rhythm |
| Stagger | **Stance Punish** | Wrong response to stance = Stagger |
| Finish | **Transformation** | Becomes "Harvest Mode" — any hit kills for 3 seconds |

**Stance — Scarecrow Pose:** Goes perfectly still, arms outstretched. Three things can happen:
- If attacked high: ducks and counter-hits (Staggers)
- If attacked low: hops and stomps (Staggers)
- If grabbed: body falls apart, reappears behind opponent

Opponent must guess or wait it out (stance drains Effigy's Guard).

**Unique Mechanic — Uncanny:**
- Effigy's animations have unusual timing
- Attacks have delayed/early active frames compared to animation
- Creates constant uncertainty about when to act

**Design Notes:**
- The "weird" character every roster needs
- Not random — very learnable, but uncomfortable
- Harvest Mode transformation is terrifying
- Either you "get" Effigy or you don't

---

### 8. The Apothecary

*"Hold still. This won't hurt me at all."*

**Visual:** Middle-aged woman in practical traveling clothes with many pockets. Bandolier of vials across chest. Fights with a cane that's also a blowgun. Spectacles, gray-streaked hair in a bun, absolutely zero bedside manner.

**Background:** A doctor-for-hire who's treated soldiers, bandits, and worse. Knows exactly where to hit to make it hurt. The tournament pays well, and she's curious what the monks know about anatomy.

**Playstyle:** Attrition specialist. Pokes, prods, and slowly poisons. Doesn't need big openings — just time.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Attrition** | Safe pokes, chip damage, slow Guard drain |
| Stagger | **Guard Break** | Accumulated Guard damage, no single big hit |
| Finish | **Standard** | A precise strike to a vital point |

**Stance — Examination:** Studies opponent. While held, reveals information about opponent's current Guard level (shown precisely instead of estimated). Can also cancel into a fast poke.

**Unique Mechanic — Toxicity:**
- Some attacks apply "Toxin" stacks
- Toxin slowly drains Guard over time
- Stacks up to 3; decays if not refreshed
- Fully stacked = constant Guard pressure

**Design Notes:**
- Patient, methodical, slightly sadistic
- Wins by making blocking unsustainable
- Weak burst damage, weak comeback potential
- Rewards players who can maintain control

---

### 9. The Revenant

*"Death was a door, not a wall."*

**Visual:** A knight in ancient, rusted armor. Moves slowly, heavily. Glimpses of bone through visor and joints. Carries a bastard sword too heavy for living arms. Each step sounds like a funeral bell.

**Background:** A knight who died in the old wars and didn't stop. Bound by an oath he can't remember to a lord who turned to dust. He fights because it's all that's left. Maybe one day someone will release him.

**Playstyle:** Slow, armored attrition. Walks forward and doesn't stop. Taking hits doesn't matter when you're already dead.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Attrition** | Slow advance, heavy pokes, constant threat |
| Stagger | **Armor Trade** | Many moves have armor; absorb + connect = Stagger |
| Finish | **Standard** | A massive overhead cleave |

**Stance — Inexorable:** Walking forward with sword readied. Armored during the walk. Cannot dash, cannot retreat in this stance — only advance.

**Unique Mechanic — Undying:**
- When Revenant would enter Stagger from Guard Break, he doesn't
- Instead, he enters "Last Gasp" — one more hit kills him, but he has 2 seconds of full armor
- Essentially turns desperation into a threat

**Design Notes:**
- Terrifying inevitability
- Slow enough to react to; armored enough that it doesn't matter
- Last Gasp creates dramatic reversals
- New players will panic; experienced players will respect him

### 10. The Beast

*"RUN."*

**Visual:** A woman wrapped in chains she put on herself. Feral eyes, filed teeth, hair like a mane. The chains aren't to restrain her — they're weapons when she lets go. Under stress, her features shift toward something not human.

**Background:** Born with something wrong in her blood. The change comes when she's hurt or angry. She's learned to use it, not control it. The tournament is a place where the monster is useful.

**Playstyle:** High-aggression brawler who transforms under pressure. Starts human, ends nightmare.

| Phase | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Advantage | **Burst** | High-risk, high-damage attacks |
| Stagger | **Counter Hit** | Reckless attacks that Stagger on counter |
| Finish | **Transformation** | Fully transforms; any hit during Feral state kills |

**Stance — Straining:** Visibly fighting the change. Holding builds "Feral" meter. Releasing enters human options or, if Feral is high, monster attacks.

**Unique Mechanic — The Change:**
- Feral meter builds when taking damage or landing hits
- High Feral = access to monster moves (faster, more damage, less safe)
- Stagger opportunity triggers full transformation
- In Feral Finish state: faster, wilder, any hit kills, but only lasts 3 seconds

**Design Notes:**
- The "berserker" archetype
- Terrifying when she's losing (Feral builds faster)
- Transformation finish is a commitment — miss and she's vulnerable
- High skill ceiling on managing the Change
