# Combat Phases

*The three steps to victory in Fudoshin*

---

## Overview

Every character in Fudoshin follows the same path to victory:

```
BUILD ADVANTAGE → STAGGER → FINISH
```

What makes characters unique is *how* they execute each phase. This document defines all available methods for each phase.

---

## Phase 1: Build Advantage

**Goal:** Gain Initiative, erode opponent's Guard, control the pace.

The advantage phase is the neutral game — both players are mobile, options are open, and someone needs to establish control before the kill becomes possible.

---

### Advantage Type: Pressure

**Philosophy:** "I don't let you breathe."

Relentless offense that forces constant blocking. The opponent's Guard meter fills because they can't find a gap to reset.

**Characteristics:**
- Fast normals with good frame data
- Strong strike/throw mix-ups
- Plus-on-block moves that maintain turn
- Wants to stay close

**Strengths:**
- Overwhelming against passive players
- Forces mistakes through panic
- High Guard damage over time

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to reversals and parries
- Burns own stamina/resources
- Predictable rhythm can be exploited

**Initiative Interaction:** Gains Initiative through blocked strings; loses it hard if interrupted.

---

### Advantage Type: Conditioning

**Philosophy:** "You're scared to press buttons."

Uses feints, delays, and pattern variation to make the opponent hesitate. Wins by making them second-guess every decision.

**Characteristics:**
- Moves with variable timing (chargeable, delayable)
- Feint/cancel options
- Punishes defensive reactions (parry baits, throw baits)
- Rewards patience and observation

**Strengths:**
- Defeats defensive players who rely on reactions
- Creates mental stack — opponent overthinks
- Low commitment, safe neutral

**Weaknesses:**
- Slower advantage building
- Less effective against reckless aggression
- Requires reads to convert

**Initiative Interaction:** Gains Initiative through successful reads; maintains it through threat rather than action.

---

### Advantage Type: Setplay

**Philosophy:** "Navigate my minefield."

Places objects, traps, or threats on the screen that limit opponent's options. Wins by forcing them into prepared situations.

**Characteristics:**
- Moves that create persistent stage elements
- Rewards stage positioning and setup time
- Converts space into advantage
- Often wants medium range to place and threaten

**Strengths:**
- Controls space without committing
- Forces opponent to approach on your terms
- Stacks advantages over time

**Weaknesses:**
- Needs time to set up
- Vulnerable during placement
- Loses setups when knocked down

**Initiative Interaction:** Gains Initiative by establishing stage control; traps force responses that grant Initiative.

---

### Advantage Type: Punish

**Philosophy:** "Your aggression is a gift."

Waits for opponent mistakes, then delivers devastating punishment. Wins by making aggression dangerous.

**Characteristics:**
- Strong whiff punish tools (fast, long range)
- High damage confirms
- Defensive neutral — prefers to react
- Controls space through threat of punishment

**Strengths:**
- Big damage per opening
- Beats aggressive/impatient players
- Low risk neutral game

**Weaknesses:**
- Struggles vs patient opponents
- Needs opponent to make mistakes
- Can fall behind on life lead

**Initiative Interaction:** Gains Initiative through counter-hits and whiff punishes; comfortable playing without Initiative.

---

### Advantage Type: Attrition

**Philosophy:** "Death by a thousand cuts."

Slow, safe pressure that gradually erodes Guard without taking large risks. Wins the long game.

**Characteristics:**
- Safe pokes with chip/Guard damage
- Strong keepout at the edge of mid-range
- Doesn't need big openings
- Patient, methodical pace

**Strengths:**
- Consistent advantage building
- Hard to blow up — few openings
- Wins if opponent can't force action

**Weaknesses:**
- Slow progress
- Loses to burst damage characters
- Can be out-patienced

**Initiative Interaction:** Doesn't need Initiative to function; slowly accumulates it through pokes.

---

### Advantage Type: Burst

**Philosophy:** "One read and you're done."

High-commitment, high-reward plays. Wins by landing big moves that create immediate advantage swings.

**Characteristics:**
- High damage/high Guard damage moves
- Committal specials with strong payoff
- Momentum-based — hot or cold
- All-in playstyle

**Strengths:**
- Can skip neutral with correct reads
- Terrifying when "on"
- Creates fear that opens other options

**Weaknesses:**
- Predictable when desperate
- High risk on every commitment
- Loses hard when reads are wrong

**Initiative Interaction:** Steals Initiative through big hits; bleeds it rapidly when blocked/whiffed.

---

## Phase 2: Stagger

**Goal:** Break through the opponent's defense to create a kill opportunity.

Stagger is the transitional moment — the opponent is briefly vulnerable, and the Decisive Blow becomes available. How a character achieves Stagger defines their pressure endgame.

---

### Stagger Method: Guard Break

**Description:** Fill the opponent's Guard meter through blocked attacks until it shatters.

**How It Works:**
- All blocked attacks add to Guard meter
- When Guard meter is full, opponent enters Stagger state
- Standard path available to everyone

**Character Fit:** Pressure, Attrition characters naturally fill Guard through volume.

**Counterplay:** Parry (restores Guard), Evade (avoids Guard damage), don't block passively.

---

### Stagger Method: Command Grab

**Description:** A special unblockable grab that causes Stagger on hit.

**How It Works:**
- Dedicated grab move with Stagger property
- Slower startup than normal grab (reactable with practice)
- Cannot be blocked — must be avoided or interrupted
- Causes Stagger regardless of Guard meter

**Character Fit:** Grapplers, mix-up characters who force blocking then grab.

**Counterplay:** Jump, backdash, or interrupt with attack. Requires hard read on grab timing.

---

### Stagger Method: Counter Hit

**Description:** Specific moves cause Stagger when they land as counter hits.

**How It Works:**
- Designated "Stagger moves" only Stagger on counter hit
- Requires catching opponent during their move's startup/recovery
- Rewards reads and frame traps

**Character Fit:** Punish, Conditioning characters who bait and punish actions.

**Counterplay:** Don't press buttons recklessly. Respect the threat.

---

### Stagger Method: Trap Trigger

**Description:** Stage elements (traps, summons, etc.) cause Stagger under certain conditions.

**How It Works:**
- Character places traps/objects during Setplay
- Opponent touching/triggering trap while Guard is above threshold (50%+) causes Stagger
- Rewards setup and herding opponent into position

**Character Fit:** Setplay characters who control space with persistent elements.

**Counterplay:** Destroy traps if possible, avoid triggering them, rush down before setup completes.

---

### Stagger Method: Armor Trade

**Description:** A move with armor that Staggers if it absorbs a hit and connects.

**How It Works:**
- Armored move absorbs one hit without interruption
- If the armored move then hits the opponent, they Stagger
- The "trade" is required — must absorb to Stagger

**Character Fit:** Heavy/armor characters who want to walk through attacks.

**Counterplay:** Don't attack into armor. Grab beats armor. Multi-hit moves break armor.

---

### Stagger Method: Stance Punish

**Description:** If opponent incorrectly challenges your stance, they Stagger.

**How It Works:**
- Character enters a threatening stance
- Specific opponent actions during stance cause automatic Stagger
- Rewards establishing and maintaining stance pressure

**Character Fit:** Stance-heavy characters with threatening held positions.

**Counterplay:** Respect the stance. Wait it out or use the correct counter-option.

---

## Phase 3: Finish

**Goal:** Convert Stagger into a kill (Breath loss).

The Decisive Blow is the killing stroke — but its form varies by character. This is the payoff, the spike moment, the reason you played the neutral.

---

### Finish Type: Standard

**Description:** A single, powerful strike that kills instantly.

**How It Works:**
- Universal input when opponent is Staggered
- 20-frame wind-up (telegraphed)
- Distinctive audio/visual cue
- Opponent can attempt Final Parry (4-frame window)

**Feel:** Clean. Honorable. The classic duel ending.

**Character Fit:** Balanced characters, swordfighters, martial artists.

---

### Finish Type: Execution Combo

**Description:** A short guaranteed sequence (2-4 hits) that ends in death.

**How It Works:**
- On Stagger, character performs a brief automatic combo
- Stylish, unique animation per character
- Final Parry opportunity comes on the last hit

**Feel:** Flashy. Expressive. A signature flourish.

**Character Fit:** Aggressive characters, stylish fighters, anyone with "flair."

---

### Finish Type: Transformation

**Description:** Entering a brief powered state where any clean hit kills.

**How It Works:**
- On Stagger opportunity, character transforms/powers up
- Transformation lasts ~3 seconds or until hit
- Any connecting attack during transformation = kill
- Final Parry available against any hit

**Feel:** Terrifying. Climactic. The "final form" moment.

**Character Fit:** Characters with alter-egos, rage modes, or hidden power.

---

### Finish Type: Trap Trigger

**Description:** Staggered opponent contacting a trap dies.

**How It Works:**
- Traps placed earlier become lethal when opponent is Staggered
- Character must herd Staggered opponent into trap
- Brief Stagger window creates urgency

**Feel:** Calculated. "All according to plan." The trap finally springs.

**Character Fit:** Setplay characters who prepared the battlefield.

---

### Finish Type: Grapple

**Description:** A command grab that instantly kills Staggered opponents.

**How It Works:**
- Special grab input during Stagger state
- Unblockable — opponent must avoid or wasn't in range
- No Final Parry (grabs can't be parried)
- Shorter range than standard Decisive Blow

**Feel:** Brutal. Inevitable. Once caught, it's over.

**Character Fit:** Grapplers, heavy characters, anyone who gets in close.

---

### Finish Type: Counter

**Description:** Decisive Blow only available as a counter/punish.

**How It Works:**
- Cannot initiate Decisive Blow on Staggered opponent
- Instead, a counter stance becomes available
- If opponent attacks during counter window, instant kill
- If they don't attack, Stagger wears off

**Feel:** Poetic. "You did this to yourself." Ultimate read.

**Character Fit:** Defensive specialists, counter-focused characters, patient masters.

---

## Character Matrix Template

Each character is defined by their combination:

| Character | Advantage | Stagger | Finish |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Example A | Pressure | Guard Break | Standard |
| Example B | Setplay | Trap Trigger | Trap Trigger |
| Example C | Punish | Counter Hit | Counter |
| Example D | Burst | Armor Trade | Grapple |

A character can have **one primary** and **one secondary** method for Advantage.

Stagger and Finish are typically **one method each**, though some characters may have situational alternatives.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Every character engages.** No full-screen zoning. Medium range maximum.

2. **The goal is always the same.** Build Advantage → Stagger → Finish. No alternative win conditions.

3. **Methods create identity.** The *how* defines the character, not the *what*.

4. **Counterplay exists.** Every Stagger method has counters. Every Finish has risk (except Grapple, which has range limitation).

5. **Final Parry is universal.** The defender always has one last chance (except vs. Grapple Finish).
