# Fudoshin — Character Roster

---

## Design Philosophy

Every character embodies a different relationship to fudoshin — the immovable mind. They are not "good" and "evil" or "fast" and "slow" archetypes. They are different *philosophies of combat* made playable.

The roster is intentionally small: four characters. Depth over breadth. Each character should feel like a complete martial art unto themselves.

---

## The Roster

| Character | Archetype | Core Fantasy |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **剣士 The Ronin** | Balanced / Spacing | The perfect cut at the perfect distance |
| **僧 The Monk** | Counter / Parry | Your aggression is your undoing |
| **鬼 The Oni** | Heavy / Armor | Unstoppable force, inevitable arrival |
| **影 The Shade** | Mobile / Mix-up | Killing you before you know where I am |

---

# 剣士 The Ronin (Kenshi)

*"The sword is already where it needs to be."*

## Philosophy

The Ronin is the purest expression of ma-ai — the sacred distance. They win by controlling space, by being exactly where they need to be, by making the opponent come to them and punishing the approach.

A Ronin player is patient. They don't chase. They create a zone where approaching is death, and they wait for the mistake.

## Playstyle

**Strengths:**
- Excellent mid-range normals
- Best whiff punishment in the game
- Strong Stance game (Drawn Blade)
- Balanced in all situations

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited mix-up potential
- Predictable at close range
- Struggles when cornered
- Must win neutral to win

**Ideal Player:**
Someone who loves footsies, spacing, and the "just out of reach" game. Patient players who like to frustrate opponents into mistakes.

## Move Set

### Light Attacks

**Neutral Light — Quick Draw**
- Fast horizontal slash at mid-range
- Your primary poke and neutral tool
- Startup: 6f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 10f

**Forward Light — Advancing Cut**
- Slight step forward into slash
- Good for catching backdashes
- Startup: 8f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 11f

**Back Light — Retreating Slice**
- Step back while slashing
- Creates space while attacking
- Startup: 7f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 10f

### Heavy Attacks

**Neutral Heavy — Overhead Cleave**
- Powerful downward slash
- Excellent for punishing whiffs
- Startup: 14f | Active: 4f | Recovery: 18f

**Forward Heavy — Lunging Thrust**
- Long-range forward stab
- Maximum reach in the game
- Startup: 16f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 20f

**Back Heavy — Draw Cut**
- Quick iaido-style slash from sheath
- Faster than other Heavies, less damage
- Startup: 12f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 16f

### Grab

**Shoulder Throw**
- Standard throw, tosses opponent forward
- Good for corner carry
- Startup: 10f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 20f

### Stance: Drawn Blade (居合 / Iai)

*Enter by holding Heavy*

The Ronin enters a ready stance, hand on sword hilt. The blade is not drawn — but it could be at any moment.

**Properties:**
- Threatens fast, powerful slash
- Opponents cannot approach safely
- Holding drains Guard (~3% per second)
- Maximum hold time: ~3 seconds

**Options from Stance:**

| Input | Action | Properties |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Release Heavy | **Iai Slash** | Fast slash (12f startup), high damage, excellent range |
| Forward | **Iai Step** | Quick forward step, maintains Stance |
| Back | **Cancel** | Return to neutral, small Initiative loss |
| Light | **Feint** | Animation fake, cancel into Light attack |

**The Mind Game:**
The Ronin doesn't need to attack from Drawn Blade. The *threat* is the value. The opponent must respect the Iai Slash, which limits their options. The Ronin can hold, advance, or feint based on the opponent's fear response.

### Decisive Blow: Silent Edge

The Ronin sheathes their blade, pauses, then performs a single perfect cut. The opponent falls before they realize they've been struck.

**Visual:** Iaido-style draw cut. Screen goes white, ink slash, opponent splits.

---

# 僧 The Monk (Sō)

*"Your aggression is a gift."*

## Philosophy

The Monk is the embodiment of go no sen — the counter-initiative. They do not strike first. They create openings by making the opponent attack, then turn that aggression back on them.

A Monk player is a wall. Push against them and you'll find yourself on the ground. Their patience is a weapon.

## Playstyle

**Strengths:**
- Best Parry in the game (Open Palm stance)
- Devastating counter-attacks
- Excellent close-range pressure after successful defense
- Rewards mastery of defensive timing

**Weaknesses:**
- Must let opponent act first (reactive)
- Poor at approaching
- Weak when forced to attack
- Struggles against patient opponents

**Ideal Player:**
Someone who loves Parrying, who finds satisfaction in turning aggression back on the attacker. Players who win by making opponents defeat themselves.

## Move Set

### Light Attacks

**Neutral Light — Palm Strike**
- Quick palm thrust
- Short range but fast
- Startup: 5f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 9f

**Forward Light — Advancing Palm**
- Step forward with palm
- Good for closing distance after Parry
- Startup: 7f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 10f

**Back Light — Deflecting Palm**
- Defensive strike that retreats slightly
- Safe on block
- Startup: 6f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 9f

### Heavy Attacks

**Neutral Heavy — Crushing Palm**
- Two-handed palm strike
- High damage, causes wallbounce in corner
- Startup: 13f | Active: 4f | Recovery: 17f

**Forward Heavy — Flowing Strike**
- Circular arm movement into palm
- Has autoparry during startup (frames 4-8)
- Startup: 15f | Active: 4f | Recovery: 19f

**Back Heavy — Rooting Strike**
- Downward palm to chest
- Causes extended Stagger on counter-hit
- Startup: 12f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 18f

### Grab

**Shoulder Lock**
- Aikido-style joint lock
- Can choose throw direction (forward or back)
- Startup: 11f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 21f

### Stance: Open Palm (開手 / Kaishu)

*Enter by holding Block*

The Monk enters an open stance, palms forward. They are inviting attack.

**Properties:**
- Enhanced Parry window (8f → 12f)
- Successful Parry guarantees Heavy Counter
- Holding drains Guard faster (~5% per second)
- Maximum hold time: ~2 seconds

**Options from Stance:**

| Input | Action | Properties |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Parry timing | **Perfect Parry** | Extended window, guaranteed Heavy Counter |
| Heavy | **Flowing Strike** | Heavy with autoparry frames |
| Back | **Cancel** | Return to neutral |
| Evade | **Circle Step** | Enhanced Evade with faster recovery |

**The Mind Game:**
The Monk in Open Palm is daring the opponent to attack. Smart opponents will wait it out (Guard drain) or Grab (beats Parry). But if they attack and the Monk reads it, they're eating a guaranteed Heavy Counter.

### Decisive Blow: Heart Strike

The Monk places one palm on the opponent's chest, pauses, then channels force through them. The opponent crumples.

**Visual:** Quiet, intimate. The Monk simply touches them. Then the opponent collapses.

---

# 鬼 The Oni (Ki)

*"I do not move. I arrive."*

## Philosophy

The Oni is the expression of pure forward pressure. They are slow, readable, and inevitable. Their armor means they don't care about Light attacks. Their damage means one correct read can end a round.

An Oni player is a freight train. You can see them coming. It doesn't help.

## Playstyle

**Strengths:**
- Light Armor on Heavy attacks (absorbs one Light)
- Highest damage in the game
- Terrifying when close
- Tenuki is strongest here

**Weaknesses:**
- Slowest movement
- Most readable attacks
- Loses to spacing and patience
- Can be out-maneuvered

**Ideal Player:**
Someone who loves hard reads, who wants to make a statement. Players who enjoy the mind game of "I know what you're going to do, and I don't care."

## Move Set

### Light Attacks

**Neutral Light — Demon Slap**
- Heavy backhand
- Slow for a Light but high damage
- Startup: 8f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 12f

**Forward Light — Lunge Swipe**
- Forward movement with horizontal swipe
- Good range for closing distance
- Startup: 10f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 14f

**Back Light — Dismissive Backhand**
- Swat while retreating
- Creates small space
- Startup: 9f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 13f

### Heavy Attacks

**Neutral Heavy — Demon Drop**
- Devastating overhead slam
- Light Armor throughout startup
- Startup: 18f | Active: 5f | Recovery: 22f

**Forward Heavy — Charging Blow**
- Step forward into massive punch
- Light Armor frames 6-14
- Startup: 20f | Active: 4f | Recovery: 24f

**Back Heavy — Ground Pound**
- Slam the ground, shockwave
- Light Armor frames 4-12
- Startup: 16f | Active: 5f | Recovery: 20f

### Grab

**Crushing Grip**
- Lift opponent, slam into ground
- Highest throw damage
- Startup: 12f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 22f

### Stance: Demon's Patience (鬼忍 / Kinni)

*Enter by holding Heavy after blocking an attack*

The Oni enters a braced stance. They are preparing to walk through your offense.

**Properties:**
- Full armor on next action (absorbs any single hit)
- Next Heavy attack has increased damage
- Holding drains Guard significantly (~8% per second)
- Maximum hold time: ~1.5 seconds

**Options from Stance:**

| Input | Action | Properties |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Heavy | **Empowered Heavy** | Armored, +25% damage |
| Forward | **Demon Step** | Short armored advance |
| Any hit received | **Armor Absorb** | Take damage but continue action |
| Back | **Cancel** | Return to neutral |

**The Mind Game:**
The Oni in Demon's Patience is making a statement: "Your next attack doesn't matter." Opponents must either Grab (risky, loses to armored Heavy), wait it out (Guard drain), or accept that they're going to trade and lose.

### Decisive Blow: Demon's Verdict

The Oni grabs the opponent by the head, lifts them off the ground, and crushes. Simple. Brutal.

**Visual:** No finesse. Raw power. The opponent doesn't fall gracefully — they crumple.

---

# 影 The Shade (Kage)

*"You are fighting where I was."*

## Philosophy

The Shade is the expression of emptiness — winning by not being where expected. They are fragile but elusive, weak in direct confrontation but devastating when they control the angle.

A Shade player is a ghost. They hit you from where you weren't looking, then disappear before you can respond.

## Playstyle

**Strengths:**
- Most mobile character
- Best mix-up potential
- Can reposition instantly (Flicker)
- Ambiguous offense

**Weaknesses:**
- Lowest health (one fewer state effectively)
- Loses hard to correct reads
- Committal movement options
- Dies fast if pinned down

**Ideal Player:**
Someone who loves movement, mix-ups, and making opponents guess. Players who want to feel like a ninja.

## Move Set

### Light Attacks

**Neutral Light — Shadow Cut**
- Quick knife slash
- Fastest attack in the game
- Startup: 4f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 8f

**Forward Light — Sliding Slash**
- Low slide with knife
- Can go under some attacks
- Startup: 6f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 10f

**Back Light — Fade Slash**
- Slash while backstep
- Creates significant space
- Startup: 5f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 9f

### Heavy Attacks

**Neutral Heavy — Spine Cutter**
- Upward slashing arc
- Anti-air properties
- Startup: 11f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 15f

**Forward Heavy — Lunging Stab**
- Quick forward stab
- Fastest Heavy in the game
- Startup: 12f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 16f

**Back Heavy — Whirling Blade**
- Spinning slash with retreat
- Hits both sides
- Startup: 13f | Active: 4f | Recovery: 17f

### Grab

**Throat Grip**
- Quick grab, repositions behind opponent
- Switches sides
- Startup: 9f | Active: 2f | Recovery: 19f

### Stance: Flicker (明滅 / Meimetsu)

*Enter by holding Evade*

The Shade's form becomes indistinct, flickering. They are partially here and partially... elsewhere.

**Properties:**
- Brief visual obscurity (harder to read movement)
- Can release into instant reposition (choose 4 directions)
- Reposition has no i-frames but is very fast
- Holding drains Guard (~4% per second)
- Maximum hold time: ~2 seconds

**Options from Stance:**

| Input | Action | Properties |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Direction + Release | **Flicker Step** | Instant reposition in direction |
| Light | **Flicker Slash** | Attack during reposition |
| Heavy | **Flicker Stab** | Heavy attack during reposition |
| Block | **Cancel** | Return to neutral where you are |

**The Mind Game:**
The Shade in Flicker is asking: "Where will I be?" Opponents must guess the direction, and guessing wrong means eating a crossup or losing track of the Shade entirely. But Flicker costs Guard and has no i-frames during the step — a correct read means death.

### Decisive Blow: From the Shadow

The Shade disappears, reappears behind the opponent, and drives a blade through their back. They never saw it coming.

**Visual:** The Shade fades out, the screen holds on the opponent alone, then blood blooms from their chest as they fall forward.

---

## Character Health States

The Shade has modified health states due to their fragility:

| Character | Whole | Cut | Wounded | Broken |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------|--------|
| Ronin | 100% | 75% | 50% | 25% |
| Monk | 100% | 75% | 50% | 25% |
| Oni | 100% | 80% | 55% | 30% |
| Shade | 100% | 66% | 33% | — |

The Shade effectively has only three states. "Broken" is death for them. This represents their glass cannon nature — they lose Breaths faster but deal damage quickly.

The Oni has slightly more health at each state, representing their toughness — they can survive longer in each Breath.

**Breath System Interaction:**
- All characters have 3 Breaths
- The Shade dies in 2 hits (Light → Heavy) or 3 Lights
- The Oni survives slightly longer per Breath
- Health resets to Whole at each new Breath

---

## Matchup Philosophy

Each matchup should have a distinct texture:

### Ronin vs Monk
*Spacing vs Counter*
- Ronin wants to poke from range
- Monk wants Ronin to commit to bigger attacks
- Ronin must be unpredictable
- Monk must be patient

### Ronin vs Oni
*Speed vs Armor*
- Ronin must use spacing to stay safe
- Oni must corner Ronin to apply pressure
- Ronin's Lights are armored through
- Ronin must commit to Heavies or Grabs

### Ronin vs Shade
*Control vs Chaos*
- Ronin wants to establish ma-ai
- Shade wants to make ma-ai meaningless
- Ronin must anti-air and whiff punish
- Shade must not get pinned down

### Monk vs Oni
*Counter vs Unstoppable*
- Monk's Parry is less effective (armor)
- Oni's commitment is exploitable
- Monk must use Grab more
- Oni must not get baited

### Monk vs Shade
*Defense vs Ambiguity*
- Monk struggles with crossups
- Shade must not be predictable
- Monk wants Shade to slow down
- Shade wants Monk to guess wrong

### Oni vs Shade
*Inevitable vs Elusive*
- Oni can two-touch the Shade
- Shade must never get hit
- Oni must corner and contain
- Shade must stay mobile forever

## Future Roster Considerations

If the game expands, potential additions:

**弓 The Archer (Yumi)** — Zoning archetype, controls space with projectile threats

**忍 The Shinobi (Ninja)** — Trap-based, sets up situations and forces opponent into them

**侍 The Samurai (Bushi)** — Stance-heavy, multiple stances with different properties

**巫 The Shrine Maiden (Miko)** — Buff/debuff, modifies game state temporarily

Each would need to bring a genuinely new philosophy, not just new moves. The roster should remain small and focused.
